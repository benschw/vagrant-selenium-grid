Puppet module for installing
[Docker](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker) from the [official repository](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/installation/ubuntulinux/).

This module is also available on the [Puppet
Forge](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/docker)

## Usage

The module includes a single class:

    include 'docker'

By default this sets up the docker hosted Apt repository and installs
the lxc-docker package and the required Kernel.

If you don't want this module to mess about with your Kernel then you
can disable this feature like so:

    class { 'docker':
      manage_kernel => false,
    }

By default the docker daemon will bind to a unix socket at
/var/run/docker.sock. This can be changed, as well as binding to a tcp
socket if required.

    class { 'docker':
      tcp_bind    => 'tcp://127.0.0.1:4243',
      socket_bind => 'unix:///var/run/docker.sock',
    }

### Images

The next step is probably to install a docker image, for this we have a defined type which can be used like so:

    docker::image { 'base': }

This is equivalent to running `docker pull base`.  
This is downloading a large binary so on first run can take a while.  
For that reason this define turns off the default 5 minute timeout for exec.  
Takes an optional parameter for installing image tags that is the equivalent to running `docker pull -t="precise" ubuntu`:  

    docker::image { 'ubuntu':
      image_tag => 'precise'
    }

Note: images will only install if an image of that name does not already exist.  

You can also remove images you no longer need with:  

    docker::image { 'base':
      ensure => 'absent'
    }

    docker::image { 'ubuntu':
      ensure  => 'absent',
      image_tag     => 'precise'
    }

### Containers

Now you have an image you can run commands within a container managed by docker.

    docker::run { 'helloworld':
      image   => 'base',
      command => '/bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"',
    }

This is equivalent to running the following under upstart:

    docker run -d base /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"

Run also contains a number of optional parameters:

    docker::run { 'helloworld':
      image        => 'base',
      command      => '/bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"',
      ports        => ['4444', '4555'],
      volumes      => ['/var/lib/couchdb', '/var/log'],
      volumes_from => '6446ea52fbc9',
      memory_limit => 10485760, # bytes 
      username     => 'example',
      hostname     => 'example.com',
      env          => ['FOO=BAR', 'FOO2=BAR2'],
      dns          => ['8.8.8.8', '8.8.4.4'],
    }


Ports, env, dns and volumes can be set with either a single string or as above with an array of values.

To use an image tag just append the tag name to the image name separated by a semicolon:

    docker::run { 'helloworld':
      image   => 'ubuntu:precise',
      command => '/bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"',
    }
